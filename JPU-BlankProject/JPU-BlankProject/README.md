# JPU-BlankProject

Startup database for Exia-Cesi's 1st year Java / POO / UML project

Through our project, you can test if our game works in two ways:
- First, you can do the following: After you have retrieved the JAR executable file on the Github repository and the database containing the different levels of the game, you must start the services on WampServer, XampServer or MampServer. So, you will be able to play our abandonware Boulder Dash  having these 5 levels.

- Second, you can also go through this method: After downloading the ZIP file of the project, and the database containing the different levels of the game, you import on an IDE like Eclipse, ZIP file and WampServer, XampServer or MampServer the said database. You must also specify the port(usually 3306) used by the DBMS(DataBase Management System) on the text file "model.properties" found in the "src / main / resources" project Maven "model". Then you have to do an update of your entire project; then you compile: From this moment you can play our abandonware Boulder Dash have these 5 levels.
